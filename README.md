Waze-Moovit Public Transportation Project
Description: This project is a public transportation route planning tool that calculates the exact time for a ride based on real-time data from Waze and Moovit. It uses both services to collect information on bus lines and stations, while also estimating travel times between stops.

Key Features:
Real-Time Data Retrieval: The project retrieves real-time data from Waze and Moovit, allowing users to get updated travel times and bus schedules.
Route Calculation: The system calculates the time needed for traveling between selected bus stops using Waze's routing capabilities.
Telegram Bot Integration: The tool is integrated with a Telegram bot, allowing users to interact with it through chat commands. Users can choose bus lines, view specific line stops, and get an estimated travel time.
